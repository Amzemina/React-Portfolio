      <p>
        I am a full stack web developer with a passion for learning and
        creating. I am a graduate of the UCONN Coding Bootcamp where I learned to be proficient in MERN stack. 
        I have experience working with various teams of developers to create multiple full stack
        applications. I am a fast learner and I am always looking for ways to
        improve my skills as a developer.
